Class Imbalance in Active Learning – Baseline Prototype

This repository contains a minimal prototype created to understand the workflow of pool-based active learning under class imbalance.

The implementation uses a synthetic imbalanced dataset and a simple uncertainty-based querying loop. The goal is to study querying behavior before integrating real datasets and full models.

This code is part of an initial exploratory study on class imbalance in active learning.
