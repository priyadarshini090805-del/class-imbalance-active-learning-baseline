Active Learning Baseline (Proof of Attempt)

This code implements a minimal active learning loop to demonstrate the mechanics of pool-based querying under class imbalance.

Setup:
- Synthetic dataset with 3 classes and imbalanced distribution
- Small initial labeled set
- Uncertainty-based querying using random scores as a placeholder

Purpose:
This implementation is intended as a preliminary prototype to understand the active learning workflow before integrating a full model and real datasets.

File:
- baseline.py: contains the active learning loop and query mechanism
